‘That’s just not possible’ 
‘Charlotte, that’s such an honour, and I feel privileged to have been asked. However, because [insert non-negotiable reason here, e.g. I’m so terrified of public speaking; I’ve been known to faint], I wouldn’t be able to give this important task/role the time and effort it deserves, and I don’t want to let you down. Would you consider asking Fatima instead?’
‘Hey Ellen, thanks for thinking of me! Unfortunately I don’t think I’m the best person to write your recommendation because I haven’t spent enough time seeing you write briefs, which seems like an integral part of this role. Good luck in your job search!’
Reduce your availability : Don’t give out your number to anyone except close friends and family. Encourage people to text you rather than leaving you voicemail messages. Reduce the number of Facebook ‘friends’ you have.
appreciate the gesture while refusing it : ‘Janet, that’s so lovely of you! But I’ve already planned to have a beach day and a picnic – I’ll be sending out invites next week.’
‘Thanks but I’m good with my current mobile plan. Please remove me from your call list. Cheers!’
No bandwidth situation : ‘That sounds really interesting, and I’d be happy to do it – but that means I won’t be able to submit the report by Friday. So let me know what you want me to prioritise.’
Sometimes you’re gonna have to say no when you’ve said yes before : ‘While I loved the opportunity to present to the CEO, you know that public speaking isn’t really my forte, so I won’t do it this quarter.’
